          acoustic guitar with friends. Past experiences has allowed me to understand realworld management, business
          ownership and customer experience.
          My goal is to create a framework individaully designed specified by the client.Please standby for updates and
          new projects I will be working on. I am currently using only HTML, CSS, JS, BOOTSTRAP and JQuery. I will be
          introducing Angular
          and React on future projects starting September 2019. Thanks again for stopping by and have a great day !
